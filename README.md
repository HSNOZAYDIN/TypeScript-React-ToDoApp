This project is a simple Todo application built using TypeScript. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, completing, and deleting todo items. It emphasizes type safety and modern JavaScript features, leveraging TypeScript to prevent common runtime errors and improve code maintainability.

Key Features:

Add Tasks: Users can create new todo items with clear descriptions.

Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as completed to track progress.

Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks they no longer need.

Type Safety: Leveraging TypeScript ensures fewer bugs and clearer code structure.

User-Friendly Interface: Minimalist design for a simple and intuitive user experience.

This project serves as a practical example of using TypeScript for front-end development, demonstrating how types can improve reliability in everyday web applications.
